DevFinder is a web application designed to **connect developers with companies** looking for qualified professionals. Developers can also find partners to collaborate on projects.

Companies can post job openings and search for candidates that meet their requirements. Developers can create profiles, list their skills, and look for job opportunities or open projects.

The site also features a **feedback system**, allowing companies to rate developers after a project and vice versa.
